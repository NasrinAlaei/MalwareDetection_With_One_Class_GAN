The Windows operating system, as the most widely used desktop operating system, remains one of the primary targets for malware developers. Consequently, numerous studies have recently focused on detecting Windows malware. Although deep learning has been employed to detect Windows malware, challenges persist, such as detecting new and zero-day malware and the lack of evolution in feature engineering processes, which increases the false positive rate. This enabled us to detect anomalies and zero-day malware by introducing a deep one-class generative adversarial network model. 
A generative adversarial network is a type of deep adversarial network which is used to unknown and invalid data detection. the main goal in this network is to ascertain whether an input sample belongs to the distribution of the training data or not. Therefore, in the proposed classifier model, the generator's aim is to generate benign pseudo-data sample and the discriminator's goal is to separate benign data from malware. the generator upon receiving the noise vector as input produces new data that is similar to the desired class. This noise vector, which is a multidimensional vector, is sampled either from a Gaussian distribution or a uniform distribution and is created and used as a random source to generate new data during training. In fact, this network acts as a method for detecting zero-day malware without needing labels for the malware, thereby identifying them. During the training process and at every execution stage, the discriminator network learns weights on real benign data and compares its learnings with the distribution of fake benign data. Ultimately, the cost function for the discriminator network is calculated.
